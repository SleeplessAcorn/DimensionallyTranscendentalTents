# Nomagi

A Runescape/Dr Who/Harry Potter crossover mod. Kinda.

Basically the Player Owned Houses system from Runescape, but in a pocket tent.

Most rooms have specific purposes, though there are also free-build rooms.

Free build rooms can be combined (up, down, and on any side) to create much larger rooms.
